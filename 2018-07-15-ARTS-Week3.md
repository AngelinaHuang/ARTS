### Description
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
### Examples
> Given ```"abcabcbb"```, the answer is ```"abc"```, which the length is 3.
> 
Given ```"bbbbb"```, the answer is ```"b"```, with the length of 1.

> Given ```"pwwkew"```, the answer is ```"wke"```, with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

### Solution
Here is the solution.We use HashSet to store the character which is without duplicate charaters in the string,first we initial two index ```i```,```j```,then we start at 0,use ```if``` statement to find whether this char character have duplicate character in the string,then the ```i``` or ```j``` count 1,etc.After this comperation from the start to the end.we can get the length of the string and the total duplicate characters,so we can use```j-i```to get our answer.
```
 public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        int ans = 0, i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < n && j < n) {
            // try to extend the range [i, j]
            if (!set.contains(s.charAt(j))){
                set.add(s.charAt(j++));
                ans = Math.max(ans, j - i);
            }
            else {
                set.remove(s.charAt(i++));
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
```
# Review
I learn java-Exceptions this week.  
Here are four types of promblem that we need to consider   

*User input error   
*Device errors   
*Physical limitations.   
*Code errors.   

#### Note:
>
The name RuntimeExcetion is somewhat confusing.Of course,all of the errors we are discussing occur at runtime.   

#### Steps to throwing an exception:
>1.Find an appropriate exception class.   
>2.Make an object of that class.   
>3.Throw it.

#### Relationship with C++:
***
C++ has two fundamental exceptional classes,runtime_error and logic_error.The logic_error class is the equivalent of Java's RuntimeException and also denotes logical errors in the programs.The runtime_error class is the base classs for exceptions caused by unpredictable problems.It is equivalent to those exception in Java that are not of type RuntimeException.

# Tips
Here is a tips about selenium+python automation testing-js controller scroll,this function  doesn't exist the problem of compatibility:
***   
\#scroll to the bottom
```   
js = "window.scrollTo(0,document.body.scrollHeight)"   
driver.execute_script(js)   
```
\#scroll to the top
```   
js="window.scrollTo(0,0)"   
driver.execute_script(js)
```

here is an example:   
```   
\# coding:utf-8   
from selenium import webdriver   
driver = webdriver.Firefox()   
driver.get("https://www.baidu.com")   
print driver.name   
q=document.documentElement.scrollTop=10000"   
\#scroll to the bottom  
js = "window.scrollTo(0,document.body.scrollHeight)" 
driver.execute_script(js)
\#scroll to the top   
js = "window.scrollTo(0,0)" 
driver.execute_script(js)
\# forcus the dot  
target = driver.find_element_by_xxxx()
driver.execute_script("arguments[0].scrollIntoView();", target)   

```

when i use "yum" command to install,it occures following error:
>[root@malu2 ~]# yum install vim   
>Loaded plugins: fastestmirror   
>Loading mirror speeds from cached hostfile   
>* base: mirror.hosting90.cz   
>* extras: mirror.hosting90.cz   
>* updates: mirror.hosting90.cz   
>Setting up Install Process   
>No package vim available.   
>Nothing to do   

I used to update yum,but it's not work this time,so i use function find to list the package of yum:
>[root@malu2 yum.repos.d]# yum search vim   
>Loaded plugins: fastestmirror   
>Loading mirror speeds from cached hostfile   
>* base: mirror.hosting90.cz   
>* extras: mirror.hosting90.cz   
>* updates: mirror.hosting90.cz   
>===================== Matched: vim ===================   
>vim-X11.x86_64 : The VIM version of the vi editor for   
>the X Window System.   
>vim-common.x86_64 : The common files needed by any   
>version of the VIM editor.   
>vim-enhanced.x86_64 : A version of the VIM editor   
>which includes recent: enhancements.   
>vim-minimal.x86_64 : A minimal version of the VIM editor.   

after find the package,we can see yum list the details equavilant of vim package,then we can install vim:
\```#yum -y install vim-enhanced.x86_64```
