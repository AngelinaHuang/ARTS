I found an article about tree-traversal in medium-[breath-vs-depth-first-tree-traversal](https://medium.com/@aturek14/breadth-vs-depth-first-tree-traversal-f42aa2c8631c),it reminds me when i was study data structure at school,i was very confused about how it works.Even though i trid many ways to figure it out,i still can't use programme language to express it.But when i watched a video about data structure,i become interested in it.All in one,when came across abstract problem,i think the best way to figure it out is watch some explaination video,it will help it a lot.
