### Discription
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.   
##### Example 1:
  > Input: 123   
  > Output: 321   
##### Example 2:
  > Input: -123   
  > Output: -321
##### Example 3:
  > Input: 120   
  > Output: 21
##### Note:
  > Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
### Solution
At first,my solution like this:

```
    public int reverse(int x) {
    int a;
    int b;
    int c；
    int tmp;
    a=x/100;
    b=x%10;
    c=(x%100-b)/10;
    tmp=b*100+c*10+a;
    return tmp;
    }
```
Obviously,i just deal with the situation of three-digit number,and it needs to make sure input standard number just like "123","234"etc.Then i review the "%" and "/",in order to make sure this solution fits all numbers,as long as it's meaningful,it can be reversed."%" can make sure just get the reminder,for example,if counted 10%3,the reminder is 1,if counted 10/3,the result is 3.So if i need to get the unit's digit,i should use"%",then use "/" to remove the unit's digit.Use while statement to do loop.
```

    public int  reverse(int x){      
       long tmp = x;
       // 防止结果溢出    
       long result = 0;
        while (tmp != 0) {
            result = result * 10 + tmp % 10;
            tmp = tmp / 10;
        }

        // 溢出判断 
        if (result < Integer.MIN_VALUE || result > Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
            result = 0;
        }

        return (int) result;
    }
```
# Review
I found an article about tree-traversal in medium-[breath-vs-depth-first-tree-traversal](https://medium.com/@aturek14/breadth-vs-depth-first-tree-traversal-f42aa2c8631c),it reminds me when i was learned data structure at school,i was very confused about how it works.Even though i trid many ways to figure it out,i still can't use programme language to express it.But when i watched a video about data structure,i become interested in it.All in one,when came across abstract problem,i think the best way to figure it out is watch some explaination video,it will helps it a lot.
# Tips
As a tester,my favoriate hobby is collecting bugs and the causes.These days,when i search a c++ problems,found a intresting bug.It about [strcpy and memcpy](http://time-track.cn/strcpy-and-memcpy.html).So this will help me to located the what cause the bug.

When i review the basic knowledge about computer network,i searched an abstract note adbout computer network.i think it's useful,so i put it here,in order to reminding me some basics about computer network.here is [the basic knowledge about computer network](https://blog.csdn.net/basycia/article/details/51880172).
