### Discription
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.   
Example 1:
  > Input: 123   
  > Output: 321   
Example 2:
  > Input: -123   
  > Output: -321
Example 3:
  > Input: 120   
  > Output: 21
Note:
  > Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
### Solution

```
 public int reverse(int x) {
        long tmp = x;
        // 防止结果溢出
        long result = 0;

        while (tmp != 0) {
            result = result * 10 + tmp % 10;
            tmp = tmp / 10;
        }

        // 溢出判断 
        if (result < Integer.MIN_VALUE || result > Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
            result = 0;
        }

        return (int) result;
    }
```
# Review
I found an article about tree-traversal in medium-[breath-vs-depth-first-tree-traversal](https://medium.com/@aturek14/breadth-vs-depth-first-tree-traversal-f42aa2c8631c),it reminds me when i was learned data structure at school,i was very confused about how it works.Even though i trid many ways to figure it out,i still can't use programme language to express it.But when i watched a video about data structure,i become interested in it.All in one,when came across abstract problem,i think the best way to figure it out is watch some explaination video,it will help it a lot.
