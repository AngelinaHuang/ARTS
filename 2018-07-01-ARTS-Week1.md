##Solution
First,i think the second loop should begin with j=1,so i complete the code
```
class Solution {  
   public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            for(int j=1;i<nums.length;j++){
                if(nums[j]==target-nums[i]){
                    return new int[]{i,j};
                }
            }
        }
         throw new IllegalArgumentException("there is no solution");
    }  
}
```
then run code,it can get the right answer,but when i submit solution,it throw exception 
```throw Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 3
	at Solution.twoSum(Solution.java:5)
	at __DriverSolution__.__helper__(__Driver__.java:8)
	at __Driver__.main(__Driver__.java:54) 
```
I did't figure out what's going on ,why the array index out of bounds,then i notice that i made a mistake,if i set j equal 1, it'll recevived many repeat answer,then it'll all satisfy the limit,so i use j=i+1 instead of j=1,to make sure it won't do the useless calculation,it works!But to be honest,i still can't figure out why it throw this exception,is it because there are too many answers?
here is the solution: 
```
class Solution {  
   public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            for(int j=i+1;i<nums.length;j++){
                if(nums[j]==target-nums[i]){
                    return new int[]{i,j};
                }
            }
        }
         throw new IllegalArgumentException("there is no solution");
    }  
}
```

###Modify API response for Android app using Charles proxy
As a part of a QA team,i need to perform load tests to see how our system behaves.So i need to test system with the help of Charles Proxy tool,here are steps i need to do to modify API response for Android app using Charles proxy:
*Lanch Charles.
*Top bar menu -> Proxy -> Proxy Settings

I want to share an article about [the distrust principle in program world](http://www.ibloger.net/article/2717.html).   
Because i'm a tester,so i need to remind myself to be rigorous,this article tell me where and when to set up "denfense".   
Here are three places should pay attention to:
*program
*link
*operations   

there are many details in each place that we should pay attation to,it's very useful,and it will remind me the place that i ignored each time when i read it,i also note down many other place that i should notice in my work.80% error lies in 20% place,so it is very important to improve the sense of test.
###Summary
It's the first time to write arts in English,although i noticed that my grammer is poor,but i'll keep going.
