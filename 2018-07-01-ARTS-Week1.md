Desciption:
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
# Solution
1.At first,i define j=1,but it throw Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 3
